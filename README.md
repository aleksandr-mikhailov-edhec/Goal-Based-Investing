This project solves the retirement problem of an individual.

**Case background:**

Mr. Lionel comes to LDI team and tells: "Hey, guys! I worked very hard and managed to save $287000 for retirement". I will retire in 10 years and I want ideally to consume cash flows of $50k every year for 20 years after I retire.

Mr. Aleksandr: "Great! Let's see what we can do for you ... According to our calculations the maximum cash flows that you can secure are 25k. Would this be enough for you?"

Mr. Lionel: "Oh, this is not really as much as I would want to have..."

Mr. Aleksandr: "Well, we can construct a solution that will allow you to reach $50k goal, but it will require taking some risk. For instance, in some scenarios you will end up with a lower sum of money than $25 per year. We can tell you more on that if you tell us what is the lowest sum of money that you can live with during retirement"

Mr. Lionel: "Hmm, it is around $20k per year"

Mr. Aleksandr: "Great. Then our solution wil be ... . It will allow you to reach $50k of consumption with ... probability. Moreover, it secures your future income at the level not less than 20k. To be more precise you can get ... ... . What do you think?"

Mr. Lionel: "This is a great decision, thank you!"

**How to read the notebooks**

The case is currently under construction. The main notebook to observe is 1.4 Full Stochastic Market Simulation
Notebooks that start with "1" are about stochastic scenarious

Notebooks that start with 2 are about historical scenarious

Notebooks that start with 3 are about simulation of the whole retirement system
